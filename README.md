 This repository contains the basic and the most important machine learning algorithms and their implementations on datasets along with some small scale projects for practice.
 
 The following algorithms have been used to create the ML models:
 
 - Linear Regression 
 - Logistic Regression
 - K-Nearest Neighbors
 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
